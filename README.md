# NST-ID-Ai-Ascension

I have tried out basics of TensorFlow :-
1) How to install TensorFlow.
2) How to create a basic AI neural network which functions to predict the Y coordinate of any X coordinate for a function which is predicted using set of given coordinates input by user.
3) Now I am currently working on the Sample Rock-Paper-Scissors prediction model. Then I will start learning about Neural Style Transfer AI model.
